How It Works
User uploads a product image → The background is automatically removed using rembg.
User enters a prompt (e.g., “a wooden desk near a bright window”).
DALL·E generates the background based on the description.
Product is placed into the AI-generated background using OpenCV with perfect alignment and lighting adjustments.
Final image is displayed and available for download.




The best possible way to do this involves a mix of AI-powered background generation, object segmentation, and photorealistic rendering techniques. Here’s the most advanced and efficient approach to achieve perfect product placement in AI-generated backgrounds without misalignment, lighting issues, or unrealistic blending.

Best Possible Approach
To get professional-quality product placement, we need a pipeline that follows these key steps:

1️⃣ Remove Background from Product Image (Object Segmentation)
Method: Use Segment Anything Model (SAM) or Rembg to precisely extract the product with its fine details (edges, soft shadows, reflections).
Why? This ensures a clean cutout without harsh edges.
2️⃣ Generate AI Background (Scene Generation)
Method: Use Stable Diffusion (ControlNet) or DALL·E 3 to create highly realistic backgrounds based on user input (e.g., "a luxury marble table near a window").
Why? AI-generated backgrounds ensure variety, realism, and creative flexibility.
3️⃣ Match Product Perspective with Background (Pose Estimation)
Method: Use OpenPose or Deep Learning Pose Estimation to detect the product’s angle and align it correctly with the AI background.
Why? This ensures that products do not look “flat” or out of place.
4️⃣ Adjust Lighting & Shadows for Realism
Method: Use Neural Rendering (NeRF) + Ambient Occlusion Mapping to match lighting between the product and the AI background.
Why? Without this step, the product will look like it was “pasted” onto the background instead of belonging to it.
5️⃣ Blend the Product with the Background (Photorealistic Compositing)
Method: Use Gaussian Splatting and HDR Tone Mapping to create realistic soft shadows, reflections, and natural edge blending.
Why? This step prevents the product from looking artificial and ensures it integrates seamlessly with the scene.
🔹 Best Tech Stack for This
To implement this at a high-quality, production-ready level, use:

Step	Tool/Model	Purpose
1. Background Removal	Segment Anything (SAM) or Rembg	Extracts product cleanly
2. AI Background Generation	Stable Diffusion + ControlNet or DALL·E 3	Creates realistic, prompt-based backgrounds
3. Perspective Matching	OpenPose + Depth Estimation	Ensures product fits naturally
4. Lighting & Shadows	Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) + HDR Mapping	Matches scene lighting
5. Final Blending	Gaussian Splatting + Ambient Occlusion	Adds shadows, reflections, and depth
